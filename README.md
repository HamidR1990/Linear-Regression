# Linear Regression


##### This is python code for the linear regression algorithm. In this little projects, we use linear regression algorithm to predict the future price of a house based on some features like average income, Average of area house age, number of rooms, etc.




#### The main object of this project is to write a linear regression algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

Usa-housing which is a tradition dataset in elementary steps in machine learning for regression tasks. Its main features are:

+ "Avg. Area Income": means the average income of area inhabitants.
+ "Avg. Area House Age": means the average age of houses in the area.
+ "Avg. Area Number of Rooms": means the average number of rooms of houses in the area.
+ "Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms": means the average number of bedrooms of houses in the area.
